### Student Guidance: <mark>Decryption Task</mark>

1. **Encryption Code Review**
   - Review the provided `encrypt_file.py` script that encrypts a text file using AES encryption.
   - Understand how the script reads the content of `input.txt`, pads the plaintext, and encrypts it with a specific key.

2. **Task Overview**
   - Your task is to create a decryption function to decrypt the `encrypted.txt` file that was encrypted using the provided encryption script.
   - Import necessary modules like AES decryption and padding functions.

3. **Decryption Function Structure**
   - Create a function that:
     - Reads the encrypted file.
     - Decrypts the content using the same key that was used for encryption.
     - Removes padding from the decrypted plaintext.
     - Writes the decrypted content to a new file.

4. **Decryption Function Template**
   - Use the provided decryption function template as a reference to structure your decryption function.
   - Ensure that the decryption logic matches the encryption process to successfully decrypt the file.

5. **Decryption Process**
   - Execute your decryption function to decrypt the `encrypted.txt` file and reveal the hidden story about the mysterious hacker.
   - Verify that the decrypted content matches the original text to ensure a successful decryption process.

6. **Task Completion**
   - Once you have successfully decrypted the file, reflect on the encryption and decryption processes.
   - Consider how encryption techniques like AES can be used to secure data and the importance of key management in cryptography.

7. **Enjoy the Journey**
   - Dive into the realm of encryption and decryption to uncover the secrets hidden within the encrypted file.
   - Embrace the challenge of decrypting the story about the mysterious hacker and enjoy the learning experience.
